So far I have:
1. a list of possible notes
2. a list of possible intervals
3. the ability to find a note from a note + an interval
4. the ability to find an interval between two notes
5. the ability to recognise a min/maj triad

Next:
6. able to recognise six chords (I can't remember if there are any formal requirements beyond that the root. I think any additional thirds or fifths would be optional.)
7. able to recognise six-four chords (not a huge priority)
8. for a given chord, identify which keys in which it is diatonic
9. for a given key, identify which position the chord occupies (i, V, etc.)
