So far I have:
-a list of possible notes
-a list of possible intervals
-the ability to find a note from a note + an interval
-the ability to find an interval between two notes
-it can recognise a min/maj triad
-it can recognise the first and second inversions of major/minor triads
-it can recognise a first inverted diminished triads (ignoring second inversion as unlikely)
-it can recognise root-position augmented triads (ignoring inversions as unlikely)
-it can find the possible keys for a given chord
-it can identify the position in a key of a given note

Need to implement
-recognition of various seventh chords (dominant, major-minor, minor, major, diminished) and their inversions (ach!)
-Need to think about how you would enter a progression, and what information you'd like to see for it. I think most of
the required code is there, I would need a db, and new actions and whatnot. I think it'd be important to sketch it out
on paper before implementing anything.
